# Live-Project-Experience
# Introduction
In starting on my Live Project, we worked for two weeks with python, focusing on the front end code for a travel app.
Using Python and a virtual environment, I was able to go back and check each change I made to the source code in order to figure out my mistakesEach person on the team also worked on stores for the flight app, and overall we were able to make a very functional program that we were all proud of.
